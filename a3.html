<h1>Top Professional DSLR cameras</h1>

You would be easily forgiven for thinking that mirrorless cameras were the only thing manufacturers cared about right now. However, there’s still an enormous market for traditional DSLRs - and the good news is that there’s still plenty of excellent choices available to buy.<br><br>

Whether you’re a beginner keen to make your first step into a more serious photography hobby, or you’re already a working pro, you can find a DSLR that should happily meet your needs.<br><br> 

Picking out just one to be considered the “best” is a pretty difficult task, however. For a start, no two DSLR customers have exactly the same needs. Picking out a top-spec, top-dollar pro-level DSLR makes absolutely no sense for somebody just starting out, while somebody with more experience would be easily frustrated by an entry-level model. It could also be that you sit somewhere in the middle of the two, in which case, a mid-range all-rounder is probably what you need.<br><br>

With that in mind, despite its age, our pick of the best all-rounder remains as the Nikon D500. It’s a solid mix of functionality in a well-designed body at a decent price. What’s not to like? A newer option is the Canon EOS 90D, which has a lot of similar functions, but will require a higher budget.<br><br>

Maybe you’ve already been using a DSLR for some time and feel ready to make the next step. In which case, take a look at mid-range options which give you more space to grow and will elevate your photography even further. <br><br>

If you’re a working professional, or just a high-level enthusiast, you’ll want the ultimate camera which offers both fantastic high image quality as well as great usability. <br><br>

If you’re a beginner, take a look at cameras like the Canon EOS 800D, and the Nikon D5600. There’s also the newer Canon EOS 250D. All of these models give you a good balance of giving you much better image quality than your phone can muster, while hopefully not being too overwhelming when you’re just at the beginning of your photography journey. <br><br>

Perhaps you want something a bit more complicated. Have a look at the Nikon D500, Canon EOS 7D Mark II and the Canon EOS 90D. These are superb all-rounders which can handle different kinds of subject - perfect for the hobbyist. <br><br>If you want to consider diverting from the two big hitters, take a look at the Pentax KP - particularly if you have a loft full of old glass available to use.<br><br>

Full-frame DSLRs are generally found in the professional category, but for the enthusiast you have the option of the Canon EOS 6D Mark II. If you want the best of the best, look towards the Nikon D850, which after several years on the market is still the one to beat. <br><br>There’s also the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, or possibly the Sony A99 II, too.<br><br>

<h2>NIKON D850</h2>

Quite possibly the best camera in the world<br><br>
REASONS TO BUY
+Superb AF
+Great handling
+Fantastic battery life 
REASONS TO AVOID
-SnapBridge (bluetooth connectivity) doesn’t always work <br><br>

The slow march against the DSLR from the mirrorless battalion has been held back by the marvellous D850. The camera which is doing more for DSLR sales than probably any other model at the moment, the D850 is a superb all-rounder for the professional who shoots a little bit of everything. <br><br>

Advanced enthusiasts will also get a kick out of how well it handles a variety of different subjects. With a high-resolution 45.4 megapixel sensor, 4K video capture, a 3.2-inch tilting touchscreen, a 153-point / 99 cross-type AF system that pretty much just nails it every time, and a sturdy body, you’re unlikely to be disappointed with what the D850 can deliver.<br><br>

The D780 is, in many ways, a Nikon Z6 (mirrorless) camera inside a traditional DSLR body. It’s clearly been designed for those who crave the traditional handling and feel of a DSLR camera, rather than flipping to mirrorless. If you’ve got a whole cabinet full of DSLR lenses too, you’re also more likely to crave a DSLR for your next model, too. <br><br>

Here, we’ve got something very impressive. It uses the same sensor and processor as the Z6, but thanks to the larger body, we’ve got room for dual memory card slots and a lot more direct control dials and buttons. There’s also nifty features like 4K video recording, charging via USB and 12fps shooting.

<h2> NIKON D780 </h2>

A DSLR still more than fit for purpose in the mirrorless age<br><br>

REASONS TO BUY

+Traditional handling 
+Great battery life 
+Dual card slots
REASONS TO AVOID
-Large and heavy 
-High price compared to Z6

The D780 is, in many ways, a Nikon Z6 (mirrorless) camera inside a traditional DSLR body. It’s clearly been designed for those who crave the traditional handling and feel of a DSLR camera, rather than flipping to mirrorless. If you’ve got a whole cabinet full of DSLR lenses too, you’re also more likely to crave a DSLR for your next model, too.<br><br> 

Here, we’ve got something very impressive. It uses the same sensor and processor as the Z6, but thanks to the larger body, we’ve got room for dual memory card slots and a lot more direct control dials and buttons. There’s also nifty features like 4K video recording, charging via USB and 12fps shooting. <br><br>

Overall this is a fantastic all-rounder for those who want a full-frame model which sticks to the traditional DSLR formula. Right now, you pay a price premium or it over the Z6, but if you’ve got a load of lenses to bring with you, that extra investment will likely be worth it.<br><br>

 <h2>NIKON D500</h2>

A super well-rounded DSLR that can help you get the best shots - no matter the subject<br><br>

REASONS TO BUY
+Lots of easy access controls
+4K video recording
REASONS TO AVOID
-Not cheap
-Fixed screen

Quite probably the best APS-C DSLR currently available to buy on the market, this solidly built camera is the perfect choice for those who like to shoot a little bit of everything. It’s got a fast frame rate, which makes it ideal for sports, action and wildlife, while it can also handle landscapes, portraits and events with aplomb. <br><br>

It’s aimed primarily at advanced hobbyists, but it’s easily good enough to be used by professionals - especially as a second camera. 
It’s best if you can buy the camera with the 16-80mm kit lens, which is so much more than just your average kit optic, offering a wide f/2.8-4 maximum aperture range and producing high quality images.<br><br>

<h2> NIKON D7500</h2>

A great all-rounder for those who shoot a bit of everything<br><br>

REASONS TO BUY
+Great sensor and processor combination
+Lots of traditional controls
+Tilting touch-sensitive screen
REASONS TO AVOID
-Single SD card slot
-Connectivity can be unreliable at times<br><br>

yourself lusting after a D500, but don’t quite have the funds available, consider instead the D7500. <br><br>

It shares many of the same specifications as its older brother, including the same sensor and processor combination but with a few compromises to help keep the price lower. <br><br>

A chunky and nicely textured body makes the D7500 a nice camera to hold and use, with some modern touches like a fully articulating touch-screen to satisfy those used to smartphones and the like. <br><br>

The trade off for the lower price includes an autofocusing system that’s not quite on par with the D500, but still very good. You also don’t get the opportunity to shoot quite as fast, with 8fps available, but it’s still very useable for those who don’t shoot action every day.<br><br>

<h2>CANON EOS 800D</h2>

This versatile beginner friendly DSLR is a great way to get into the Canon ecosystem<br><br>

+Easy to get started with
+Great touchscreen
REASONS TO AVOID
-Full HD video only
-Cheaper build quality

<br><br> updates its line of entry-level DSLRs fairly regularly, so you can almost always guarantee that the latest tech is available even for beginner models.<br><br> The 800D (known as the T7i in the States) inherits some great specifications from those higher up in Canon’s line, including a snappy 45-point AF system. <br><br>

There’s also an excellent touch-sensitive articulating screen, a decent Live View performance, and, most importantly, high image quality. <br><br>
If you’re looking for a solidly built and well-rounded entry-level camera, the 800D is the ideal choice - if you’re looking to tighten the purse strings a little more, the 1300D is also a great beginner friendly option. <br><br>
