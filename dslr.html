<h1>Best DSLR camers for Begineers </h1>


The best DSLRs can match mirrorless cameras a lot more closely than you might think, as the latest models embrace the same on-sensor phase-detection autofocus systems as mirrorless cameras, to provide the same live view and video performance and with a big, grippable body and an optical viewfinder.<br><br> 

Prime examples include the Canon Rebel SL3 (EOS 250D), Canon EOS 90D and Nikon D780.<br><br>

Even with older, simpler DSLRs that don't have such sophisticated live view AF, many photographers prefer the size, weight and optical viewfinder of the digital SLR design – and for beginners, a starter level DSLR is still the cheapest way to get a camera with interchangeable lenses and a viewfinder!<br><br>

But what is the best DSLR to get? That will depend on your budget, your experience and what you want to shoot! Beginners will be looking for a low-cost camera that's easy to use, enthusiasts will want a powerful all-round camera that offer many of the tools of pro cameras but without the cost, while professional photographers will want image quality and features, for sure, but durability and dependability too. <br><br>

We've split our list of the best DSLRs into cameras for beginners, enthusiasts and pros. We've left the Canon EOS-1D X Mark III and Nikon D6 out of our list, below, because these are seriously expensive and specialized cameras for pro sports photographers – but if that's where your interest lies, take a look at our guide to the best cameras for professionals.<br><br>


We've listed these entry-level DSLRs according to those we think are the best all-round choice for beginners, but we rate them all for different reasons, so it depends on whether low cost is the most important thing for you or the best features.<br><br>


 <h2> Nikon D3500</h2><br>

The perennial favorite for beginners, students and anyone on a budget<br><br>

Type: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Nikon F (DX) | Screen: 3in, 921,000 dots | Max burst speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p (Full HD) | User level: Beginner</h2><br><br>


Interactive ‘Guide’ shooting modeSolid performance; good handlingFairly basic controlsLCD has no tilt or touchscreen
The Nikon D3500 back in 2018, and is an evolution of Nikon's best-selling line of digital cameras. <br><br>We also rate it as one of the best Nikon cameras right now, as well as one of the best cameras for beginners. Novice photographers are often worried about DSLRs being complicated to use, but the Nikon D3500 has a brilliant ‘Guide’ shooting mode that acts as a fully interactive tutorial on photography, delivered via the rear LCD screen. The rear screen is fixed, and you’re limited to Full HD video rather than 4K, but the 24-megapixel sensor delivers super-sharp images and the retracting 18-55mm kit lens is rather good too.<br><br> The D3500 is small, light, cheap and easy to use – all the qualities that will appeal to beginners. It might seem as if camera technology is advancing at breakneck speed right now, but the D3500 has all the qualities we still look for in a beginner camera, and we still haven't seen anything to touch it at this price. <br><br>

2.<h2> Canon EOS Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D</h2><br><br>

If you stretch your budget, you can get 4k and a vari-angle touchscreen<br><br>

Type: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3in vari-angle touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Max burst speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 4K | User level: Beginner<br><br>

Guided screen optionsPivoting touchscreen4K videoThe body might be too small for some<br><br>

Canon does make a couple of cheaper DSLRs than this one, but we reckon they’re a little cut down in features and build quality and we’d recommend paying just a little bit extra for the EOS Rebel SL3 DSLR (sold as the EOS 250D in Europe). <br><br>

Why? Because it has a vari-angle touchscreen on the back and a sensor with Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology, so the autofocus in live view is really snappy. <br><br>We also love the fact that you can start from a simple Guided user interface when you’re still learning, and then switch to the standard setup when you feel more confident and want more control. This is the best DSLR for beginners keen to learn and experiment with new techniques – it's also as good in live view mode as a mirrorless camera. We're looking forward to trying out the new EOS 850D, but for now, this is the entry-level Canon DSLR we'd recommend, and it's hard to imagine anything beating this more advanced beginner camera for features and value right now.<br><br>

<h2> Canon EOS Rebel T100 / EOS 4000D</h2><br><br>
A bare-bones camera that really strips back the cost<br><br>

Type: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C | Megapixels: 18MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 2.7in fixed, 230,000 dots | Max burst speed: 3fps | Max video resolution: 1080p (Full HD) | User level: Beginner<br><br>


Super-cheap to buyEasy to usePoor viewfinder and screenNo image stabiliser on kit lens
Canon has deliberately built the EOS Rebel T100 (EOS 4000D) down to a price, and we think they might have taken the cost cutting a fraction too far. It's a decent camera, but only if you can get it for a lot less than the Nikon D3500, above. <br><br>

The Canon is well suited to beginners, with the same ‘intelligent’ full auto shooting mode and feature guide as you’ll find in pricier Canon cameras. The ‘Quick’ menu is typically intuitive, and there are plenty of scene modes as well as more advanced shooting modes. There’s also a Creative Auto mode to help you progress from ‘basic zone’ to ‘creative zone’ modes. The 18MP image sensor is a little lacking in megapixels compared with most current DSLRs, though, and there are more serious cutbacks in other areas. We wouldn’t expect a touchscreen at this price, but the rear LCD is disappointingly small and low-resolution. Ultimately, it’s a very basic camera but the best DSLR to get if you just want to dip your toe in the photographic water and spend as little cash as possible.<br><br>

ENTHUSIASTS<br><br>
How much do you want to spend on your hobby? We kick off this enthusiasts section with APS-C cameras because they offer very good image quality, features and performance at a very affordable price point. <br><br>But we've also chosen some full frame alternatives for photographers prepared to spend a little more. This will bring you a noticeable step up in quality and are a great first step in to the full frame camera systems used by professionals.<br><br>


<h2>Canon EOS 90D</h2>

It's the enthusiasts DSLR with everything!<br><br>

Type: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C | Megapixels: 32.5MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3in vari-angle touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Viewfinder: Pentaprism | Max burst speed: 10fps | Max video resolution: 4K UHD | User level: Enthusiast<br><br>The Canon EOS 200D II

Highest APS-C resolution yet10fps continuous shootingUncropped 4K videoLimited buffer capacity18-135mm IS USM lens disappointingLosing detail by ISO 1600
This is the best Canon camera for enthusiasts, and it arrived with groundbreaking specs that no other camera in this category can match and could leave a few professional photographers and videographers taking a look too. The EOS 90D packs in an amazing 32.5 million pixels – the highest yet for an APS-C camera – though don't expect to see any obvious and instant benefit in image quality. Instead, revel in this camera's 10fps continuous shooting capability and its uncropped 4K video capture – a consumer level Canon that (finally) doesn't reduce the angle of view for 4K video. The extra megapixels do dent the EOS 90D's high ISO/low light performance, but this camera has so many capabilities and so much potential, we think it's a dazzlingly good all-rounder for enthusiasts who want to try every facet of photography.<br><br>


<h2>Nikon D7500</h2>

Nikon’s answer to the EOS 90D can't match its specs but it is cheaper<br><br>

Type: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C | Megapixels: 20.9MP | Lens mount: Nikon DX | Screen: 3.2in tilting touchscreen, 922,000 dots | Viewfinder: Pentaprism | Max burst speed: 8fps | Max video resolution: 4K | User level: Enthusiast<br>

Has the best bits from the D500Lightweight buildLess robust than the D500Downgraded autofocus system
Nikon fans looking for an all-round equivalent to the do-it-all Canon EOS 90D should take a look at the Nikon D7500. <br><br>

Also designed for enthusiasts, it offers a slightly faster 8fps continuous shooting speed, a proven 51-point autofocus system and the ability to capture 4K video. <br><br>It has a tilting rear screen rather than the fully-articulated design on the EOS 90D and relies on slower contrast AF in live view mode, but if you do most of your shooting through the viewfinder these will be small points. <br><br>The D7500 also has a lower resolution (20MP vs 32.5MP) but in real-world shooting its high-performance sensor delivers images which are not far behind the definition offered by the Canon, despite the difference in megapixels. Nikon fans who like sports photography might also want to take a look at the Nikon D500, but this is a much more expensive camera and it's growing harder to find.<br><br>
